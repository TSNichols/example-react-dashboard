# Example Dashboard UI

Created as practice working with React, MUI, and other libraries to build a dashboard ui app. 

While the "dashboard" page is responsive, the sidebar and charts do not play well on mobile size screens - this would be an area of future improvement.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
